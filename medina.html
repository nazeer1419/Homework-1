			<p>The city is known to have existed for over 1500 years before Muhammad's migration from Mecca, 
			otherwise known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim caliphate under 
			Muhammad's leadership, serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad's 
			Ummah (Community), composed of the citizens of Madinah, known as the Ansar and those who immigrated 
			with Muhammad, known as the Muhajirun, collectively known as the Sahaba, gained huge influence. 
			Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Masjid Quba'a, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, 
			with the masjid at Quba'a being the oldest in Islam. A larger portion of the Qur'an was revealed in 
			Medina in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.</p>
