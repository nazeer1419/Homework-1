			<p>Qatif is one of the oldest settlements in Eastern Arabia, its history going back 
			to 3500 BC. Before the discovery of oil, Qatifi people used to work as merchants, 
			farmers, and fishermen. However, in recent years, after the discovery of oil and 
			establishment of Jubail Industrial City, most Qatifi people tend to work in the oil 
			industry, public services, education and health-care sectors.</p>
