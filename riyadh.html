			<p>The first mentioning of the city by the name Riyadh was in 1590, by an early 
			Arab chronicler. In 1737, Deham Ibn Dawwas, who was from the neighboring Manfuha, 
			settled in and took control of the city. Deham built a wall around the city, and 
			the best known source of the name Riyadh is from this period, thought to be referring 
			to the earlier oasis towns that predated the wall built by Ibn Dawwas. In 1744, 
			Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab formed an alliance with the Emir of Dir'iyah, Muhammad 
			bin Saud, and in 1774, they took Riyadh from Deham. However their state, now known as 
			the First Saudi State, came to a collapse in 1818. Turki ibn Abdullah founded the Second 
			Saudi State in the early 19th century and made Riyadh his capital in 1825. However, 
			his reign over the city was disrupted by a joint Ottoman–Rashidi alliance. Finally, in 
			the early 20th century, 'Abdulaziz ibn Saud, known in the west simply as Ibn Saud, 
			retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926 with 
			the final Saudi conquest of Hejaz. After this he named his kingdom Saudi Arabia in September 
			1932 with Riyadh as the capital.</p>
